## Hi there, my name is Leonardo HubertðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently studying JavaScript, Python and hopefully I'll be adding much more into my repertoir very soon!
- Located in Indaiatuba - SÃ£o Paulo - Brasil, I'm attending the new course in Fatec Indaiatuba, called DSM (Desenvolvimento de Software Multiplataforma).
- This profile will track my study progress, so in the future I can show my development as a software engineer!
